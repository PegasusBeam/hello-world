Hello humans !,

I'm Hariz a normal boy who's still trying to learn about programming and stuff.
I'm so hyped that pokemon go just got released and was hoping that i can learn how to code a bot
to initiate my bot with the pokemon go bot for my account. Still a far journey to success tho.
Well I'll try my best to achieve my goal in my life that is to be a software, network, computer or mechatronics engineer :)
